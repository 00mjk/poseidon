Software Defined Network Situational Awareness
This challenge is a joint challenge between two IQT Labs: Lab41 and Cyber Reboot. Current software defined network offerings lack tangible security emphasis much less methods to enhance operational security. Without situational awareness and context, defending a network remains a difficult proposition. This challenge will utilize SDN and machine learning to determine what is on the network, and what is it doing. This goal will help sponsors leverage SDN to provide situational awareness and better defend their networks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
[Docker Installed](https://www.docker.com/)

### Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
*editor* config/poseidon.config
docker build -f ./Dockerfile.poseidon -t poseidon .
docker run poseidon
```

### Makefile Options

You can use `make` to simplify the building process.
To build the container, simply run:

```
git clone https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
make build_poseidon
```

To build and run the container, run this command from inside the poseidon directory:
```
make run_poseidon
```
This first builds poseidon, then runs it. After it finishes running, the container is removed.

To populate the current volume with the contents of the containers' "poseidonWork/" directory, run:
```
make run_dev
```

To run poseidon with sh as entrypoint, run:
```
make run_sh
```
This also removes the container after it has finished running.

If you want to build the docs, then invoke:
```
make build_docs
```

To build and then open the docs in a container on port 8080:
```
make run_docs
```
### Configuration
config/poseidon.config
#### [Monitor]
rabbit_server =  `RABBIT_SERVER`  
rabbit_port = `RABBIT_PORT`  
collector_nic = `COLLECTOR_NIC`  
vent_ip = `VENT_IP`  
vent_port = `VENT_PORT`  
  
`RABBIT_SERVER` - ip address of the rabbit-mq server   
`RABBIT_PORT` - rabbit-mq server server port  
`COLLECTOR_NIC` - name of the network interface that will be listening for packets  
`VENT_IP` - ip address of serever running vent  
`VENT_PORT` - vent server port  

#### [NorthBoundControllerAbstraction:Update_Switch_State]
controller_uri = https://`CONTROLLER_SERVER`:8443/api/v1/  
controller_user = `USERNAME`  
controller_pass = `PASSWORD`  

`CONTROLLER_SERVER` - BCF controller ip  
`USERNAME` - username for BCF login  
`PASSWORD` - password for BCF login  

## Running the tests
Tests are currently written in py.test for Python.  The tests are automatically run when building the containers.

### Break down into end to end tests
